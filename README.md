![Welcome](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e53a9f0a-3144-4e2d-a3c2-466f0cfa2614)[^1]

I’m Antonio Magherini, graduated MSc in Civil Engineering - Hydraulic Engineering track at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), in the Netherlands.

My main interests are river morphodynamics and modelling, river interventions, flood risk and natural hazards mitigation. Hydrology and in general hydraulic engineering topics are also part of my likings.
During my studies in Delft I was introduced to the various aspects of modelling, programming, and above all the broad fields of machine learning and deep learning. 

I had the opportunity to intern at [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl/) working on my master's thesis. The reearch focused on morphological modelling of braided sand-bed rivers through deep learning and by means of satellite images. My thesis report is available in [TU Delft repository](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:38ea0798-dd3d-4be2-b937-b80621957348). The code repository is available [here](https://github.com/antoniomagherini/jamunet-morpho-braided).

Previously, I was teaching assistant at the Faculty of [Civil Engineering and Geosciences](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg) for the common module MUDE - Modelling, Uncertainty and Data for Engineers, that aims to provide the students with the necessary tools for civil engineering and earth sciences applications. More recently I was also student assistant for the project STREAMS - Stakeholder Training in River Engineering And Management Simulation, with the goal to develop a serious game for simulating stakeholder participation in river engineering decision-making processes which will be released soon.

During my second year of the master I performed some laboratory experiments on the accumulation of plastic particles upstream of hydraulic structures at the [Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory of TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/hydraulic-engineering/sections/hydraulic-engineering-laboratory). I published an abstract of this experience and presented it at the [NCR DAYS 2024](https://ncr-web.org/). If you are interested, you can read [my abstract](https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/accumulation-of-floating-particles-at-hydraulic-structures) and [the full book of abstracts](https://kbase.ncr-web.org/outputs/ncr-days-2024-book-of-abstracts/).
