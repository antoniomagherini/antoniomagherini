![Welcome](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e53a9f0a-3144-4e2d-a3c2-466f0cfa2614)[^1]

I’m Antonio Magherini, MSc student of Civil Engineering - Hydraulic Engineering track at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), in the Netherlands.

My main interests are river morphodynamic and modelling, river interventions, flood risk and natural hazards mitigation. Hydrology and in general hydraulic engineering topics are also part of my likings.

Apart from these topics, during my studies in Delft I was introduced to the various aspects of modelling, programming, and above all the broad fields of machine learning and deep learning. 

I'm currently an intern at [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl/) working on my Master thesis. My reearch focuses on predicting the morphological changes of braided sand-bed rivers through deep-learning modelling and by means of satellite images. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/antoniomagherini/jamunet_preview).

From July 2023 to April 2024 I was teaching assistant at the Faculty of [Civil Engineering and Geosciences](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg) for the common module MUDE - Modelling, Uncertainty and Data for Engineers, that aims to provide the students with the necessary tools for civil engineering and earth sciences applications.

Since February 2024 I'm also student assistant for the project STREAMS - Stakeholder Training in River Engineering And Management Simulation, with the goal to develop a serious game for simulating stakeholder participation in river engineering decision-making processes.

During my second year of the Master I also performed some laboratory experiments on the accumulation of plastic particles upstream of hydraulic structures at the [Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory of TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/hydraulic-engineering/sections/hydraulic-engineering-laboratory). I had the opportunity to publish and present an abstract of this experience at [NCR DASY 2024](https://ncr-web.org/). If you are interested, you can read [my abstract](https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/accumulation-of-floating-particles-at-hydraulic-structures) and [the full book of abstracts](https://kbase.ncr-web.org/outputs/ncr-days-2024-book-of-abstracts/).
