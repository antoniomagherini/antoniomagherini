![Welcome](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e53a9f0a-3144-4e2d-a3c2-466f0cfa2614)[^1]

Iâ€™m Antonio Magherini, graduate MSc in Civil Engineering - Hydraulic Engineering track at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), in the Netherlands.

I am passionate about river morphodynamics, hydromorphological modelling, river engineering interventions, and flood risk and natural hazard mitigation. With my work I aim to integrate these areas with emerging technologies, like machine- and deep-learning techniques as well as satellite imagery, to advance research and practical applications in fluvial systems.

I will soon start a PhD at [STREEM Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/streem/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), in Switzerland. My research project will focus on the two-dimensional characterization of river bedforms and the quantification of their contribution to sediment transport. Besides lab data analysis, I expect to include some morphological modelling with both traditional physics-based and innovative data-driven models.

I was previously a research assistant at the [University of Liege](https://www.uliege.be/cms/c_8699436/en/uliege), where I worked on numerical modelling of floating logs dynamics in rivers during floods. 

During my graduate internship at [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl/) I worked on morphological modelling of braided sand-bed rivers using deep learning and satellite images. My thesis report is available at [TU Delft repository](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:38ea0798-dd3d-4be2-b937-b80621957348). The code repository is available [here](https://github.com/antoniomagherini/jamunet-morpho-braided). I also published and presented an abstract at [EGU General Assembly 2025](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU25/EGU25-650.html).

As teaching assistant at the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences of TU Delft I contributed to the development and review of the [MUDE Textbook](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/2024/intro.html) and the [TeachBooks](https://teachbooks.io/about/). I also contributed to the creation and release of [Facing Floods](https://edusources.nl/materials/5ba408f1-5384-4569-b7f7-67319363a30e/facing-floods-a-stakeholder-river-management-game), a freely available serious game for simulating stakeholder participation in river engineering decision-making processes.
