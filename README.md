![Welcome](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e53a9f0a-3144-4e2d-a3c2-466f0cfa2614)[^1]

Iâ€™m Antonio Magherini, graduate MSc in Civil Engineering - Hydraulic Engineering track at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), in the Netherlands.

My main interests are river morphodynamics and modelling, river interventions, flood risk and natural hazards mitigation.
During my studies in Delft I was introduced to the various aspects of modelling, programming, and above all, the broad fields of machine learning and deep learning. 

I'm currently a research assistant at the [University of Liege](https://www.uliege.be/cms/c_8699436/en/uliege), working on numerical modelling of transport and collision of floating logs in rivers during floods. 

During my graduate internship at [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl/) I worked on morphological modelling of braided sand-bed rivers using deep learning and satellite images. My thesis report is available at [TU Delft repository](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:38ea0798-dd3d-4be2-b937-b80621957348). The code repository is available [here](https://github.com/antoniomagherini/jamunet-morpho-braided). I also published and presented an abstract at [EGU General Assembly 2025](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU25/EGU25-650.html).

Previously, I was teaching assistant at the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences for the common module MUDE - Modelling, Uncertainty and Data for Engineers, which provides the students with the necessary tools for civil engineering and earth sciences applications. During this period, I contributed to the development and review of the [MUDE Textbook](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/2024/intro.html) and the [TeachBooks](https://teachbooks.io/about/). Later I was also student assistant for the project STREAMS - Stakeholder Training in River Engineering And Management Simulation. Within this project we developed Facing Floods, a serious game for simulating stakeholder participation in river engineering decision-making processes. The game is freely available on [Edusources](https://edusources.nl/materials/5ba408f1-5384-4569-b7f7-67319363a30e/facing-floods-a-stakeholder-river-management-game).
